## Running DeepDive
Running DeepDive will typically involve four steps:

1. Preparing the input data
2. Simulating training datasets
3. training a DD model
4. running diversity predictions on the empirical data

The first step is performed in R, while steps 2-4 are performed by launching Python scripts after adjusting few settings as described below. The full pipeline has currently only been tested on Unix systems (MacOS or Linux). 

The example below, shows how to run these steps for the example of the marine empirical dataset. Note that the output of the intermediate steps (i.e. pre-formatted input files, simulated datasets, trained models) are also provided in compressed folders (which need to be unzipped to be used in DeepDive).

Step-by-step explanations are provided [here](https://github.com/DeepDive-project/example_files/blob/main/marine_analysis/README.md).
